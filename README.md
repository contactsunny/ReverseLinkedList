# Reverse a Singly Linked List

This is a simple Java program to demonstrate how to reverse a singly linked list.

---

## Input

The input to the program is a singly linked list with four nodes, which is 
hard-coded in the `App.java` class. The list can be visualized like this:

```shell script
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> *
-----------------------------
``` 

---

## Output

After the list has been reversed, the output will be like this:

```shell script
-----------------------------
Traversing reversed list
4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> *
-----------------------------
```
